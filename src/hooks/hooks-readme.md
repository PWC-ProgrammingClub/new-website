### Hooks

[Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)

> Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.

This folder contains custom hooks used by components for this website. Generally, they just compress a few calls to default hooks into one default function.
